			<h4>9.30am - 12pm (No intern tho)</h4>
				<h5>Rise and Shine... (Do I even do either?)</h5>
					<p>
						Ahhh... The glorious daybreak. I wish I woke up, brewed some Brttsh tea, cooked some sunshine eggs and you know, perform my morning routine. 
						Except, I can't be bothered you know? The bed beckons. In fact, why am I even typing this shit? I can do this at night. Back to sleep I go.
						See you when plants stop photosynthesizing.

				<h5>I don't need no bell curve God. I need RNGesus.</h5>
					<p>
						I've had enough. Gudako has ruined every single roll that I've tried to do. Today is the day I change everything. Today is the day I build a shrine
						and get my well deserved Merlin. I've worked hard this semester. At the very least, i deserve something great. Even if I'm a F2P scrub, I still
						deserved to be loved.... STOP STHENO SPOOKING ME!

			<h4>3pm - 5pm (I still want to sleep)</h4>
				<h5>Unto my main interest of the day.</h5>
					<p>
						I love singing. I really do. I also love to perform experiments with my voice (no human harm though!). In fact, it is a great joy performing covers,
						be it for people or for performances. However, during PPT2, Santideva said that the self does not exist. Hmmmm... what about "non-living things" like 
						glass? I tried singing to it. It cracked :/

			<h4>12am - 9am (Finally sleeping!)</h4>
				<h5>Intense HIIT Cardovascular workout</h5>
					<p>
						Indeed, I love running. It benefits one's health tremendously. Of course, who wouldn't run? I'm no exception. However, I'm a fan of productivity. I 
						lucid dream in my sleep, dreaming of running. 2 birds with 1 stone! You might be asking, my physical body has not moved an inch.  
						But you know what they say! I think, therefore I am!

						Man. If my empathy won't move you, perhaps my singing will. My concerts have fervent front-rowers. Heck, I even have my
						own fanbase. Be careful, for if you're careless, I'll sing "Careless Whispers" and you might just fall for me. <strong>wink</strong>
