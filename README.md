## :birthday: Bryan's Birthday Website
A fun birthday website for a very special friend of mine in Yale-NUS College.

## :question: Motivation
Just like any other friend, I wanted to surprise him for his birthday. However, due to COVID-19 and Circuit Breaker Measures, I was not allowed to meet him. Hence, I had to resort to other means like this! This website celebrates our inside jokes and funny moments of 2020.

## :information_source: Project Rundown
This website was done using HTML, CSS and hosted on Github Pages. Admittedly, this is a **very** simple project. However, all I wanted was to surprise him, so I did not really feel the need to go further. However, I did not implement responsive web design, which makes this website very bad at lower resolutions.
